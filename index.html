      <p>This is all about my dog, called Dot. This is her CV and here we will learn about her <em>family</em>, her
        <em>likes</em> (and dislikes), what <em>tricks</em> she can do, how <em>clever</em> she is, including
        <em>words</em> she knows, what her favourite <em>food</em> is (all food) and who she likes to <em>play</em> with.
